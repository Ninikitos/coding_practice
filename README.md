## Algorithms Practice

👋 Hey ho!

This repo is a personal practice playground for algorithms coding tasks. It’s not meant to be “THAA BEST” or “THAA FAASTEST”, it’s a place to learn by doing, compare ideas, and improve over time.

⚠️ Note: There are many ways to solve the same problem.
My solutions aim for clarity and practice first. Your solution might be shorter/faster/smarter and that’s great!

### What’s inside
1. Small `__main__` example you can run;
2. Friendly Time & Memory complexity notes (plain English + Big-O);
3. Brief information about what helped me solve a problem.

### How to run
Any module can be run directly:

`python current_folder/search/binary_search.py`
> If you disagree with the complexity note, let’s discuss. This repo is for learning together. 🙌

### Philosophy
- Progression > Perfection
- Document your thinking: TODO flows are part of the learning.
